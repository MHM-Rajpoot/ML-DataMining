### ðŸ”¹ Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled datasets to train models. It is further divided into **Classification** and **Regression** tasks.

#### Classification
- **NaÃ¯ve Bayes** â€“ Probabilistic classifier based on Bayesâ€™ theorem.
- **Logistic Regression** â€“ Models the probability of categorical outcomes.
- **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)** â€“ Instance-based learning method using similarity measures.
- **Random Forest** â€“ Ensemble of decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** â€“ Finds the optimal hyperplane for classification tasks.
- **Decision Tree** â€“ Tree-structured model for decision-making and prediction.

#### Regression
- **Simple Linear Regression** â€“ Predicts outcomes using a single independent variable.
- **Multivariate Regression** â€“ Handles multiple predictors for continuous outputs.
- **Lasso Regression** â€“ Linear regression with L1 regularization for feature selection.

### ðŸ”¹ Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled datasets to discover hidden patterns.

#### Clustering
- **K-Means Clustering** â€“ Partitions data into K clusters using centroids.
- **DBSCAN Algorithm** â€“ Density-based clustering for arbitrary-shaped clusters.

#### Dimensionality Reduction
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** â€“ Transforms features into principal components.
- **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)** â€“ Separates a multivariate signal into independent components.

#### Association
- **Frequent Pattern Growth (FP-Growth)** â€“ Efficient algorithm for frequent itemset mining.
- **Apriori Algorithm** â€“ Classic association rule learning for market basket analysis.

#### Anomaly Detection
- **Z-score Algorithm** â€“ Detects outliers based on statistical deviation.
- **Isolation Forest Algorithm** â€“ Identifies anomalies using random partitioning.

### ðŸ”¹ Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning uses both labeled and unlabeled data.

#### Classification
- **Self-Training** â€“ Iteratively labels and retrains using high-confidence predictions.

#### Regression
- **Co-Training** â€“ Uses multiple learners to iteratively label unlabeled data.

### ðŸ”¹ Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning trains agents through **trial and error** by interacting with the environment.

#### Model-Free Methods
- **Policy Optimization** â€“ Learns optimal policies directly.
- **Q-Learning** â€“ Value-based method to find the best action.

#### Model-Based Methods
- **Learn the Model** â€“ Builds an environment model for planning.
- **Given the Model** â€“ Uses a pre-defined environment model for decision-making.
